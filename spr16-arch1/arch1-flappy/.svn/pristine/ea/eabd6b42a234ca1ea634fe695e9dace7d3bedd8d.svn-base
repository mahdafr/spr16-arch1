I worked on the pipes for the flappy game project. In order to
draw multiple pipes for the game, I took a more hard-coded
approach in my implementation. I wrote a method (one influenced
by the update cursor method) to establish at which columns of
the LCD will the pipes be drawn. My implementation then called
the pipeChunk method (influenced by the cursorChunk method) to
draw the pipe in its design (with a 'lip' on the openings of
the pipes). I then came to issues on how to move the pipes to
the left, simulating the bird's flight through the LCD obstacle
course of pipes. I then considered which of the regions the
first pipe would be drawn in, and I considered a division of 3
regions of the LCD screen. Depending on which boundaries which
of the three pipes on the screen would be in, it would be a
continuation of whatever the pipe was in the right boundaries.
This would ensure the LCD would not look as if a new pipe is
drawn in each of the boundaries I had created. Furthermore,
I integrated the score to be written on the board with the
