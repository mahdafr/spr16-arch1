1. Bounds checking:
   In ch5/calendar directory are:
      - calendar_utils.c: defines methods day_of_year and month_day
        from K&R chapter 5.
      - calendar_utils.h: declares (global) methods defined in
      	calendar_utils.c
      - calendar_test.c: implements simple tests of calendar_utils
      	which quietly generate erroneous results for a bogus date
	that does not exceed array bounds.
   Your task is to
      - add bounds checking to the methods in calendar_utils.c
      - modify calendar_test.c to cause calendar_utils to trigger
      	the bounds checking mechanisms you implemented
   It is up to you to define "appropriate" behavior for these
   exceptional conditions. Appropriate does not include segfaults,
   core dumps, corruption of data structures, or quietly returning
   erroneous results.
   Your readme.txt should describe the extension of the error
   detection, handling, and triggering that you implement.
