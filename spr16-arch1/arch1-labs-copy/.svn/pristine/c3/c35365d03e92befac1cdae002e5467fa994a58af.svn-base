Description: CS3432 MSP430-Lab0

Part 1: Modify sleep_600th.s to accurately delay 1/600th of a
second. Your lab submission should include a file name readme.txt that
clearly indicates how you
     (1) computed the changes to this file
     (2) tested that these changes function correctly
     >> If there are needed to have (1/600)s for a loop:
     	   (1s/600)*(10^6cycles/s) / 3 cycles/s = 555 cycles
	delayed. So, decrementing from 555 until negative, we can
	accurately delay the MSP430 to display the blinking of the
	lights to alternate to 1/600th of a second. This math is
	assuming that the clock frequency of the MSP430 is 1MHz,
	another way of saying 1*10^6cycles/s. Timing of the LEDs is
	expected to alternate colors every second. Running the make
	file to test shows that the calculations were close enough to
	being 1s for each light. Thus, I will leave the assembly file
	as my submission for this part of the lab. The 3 cycles/s is
	the mathematical representation of the assembly code of the
	loop; it will have 3 cycles/s.

Part 2: Create a new assembly language source file name led_s.s that
implements a c-callable function led_control with the same semantics
as the version defined in led_c.c. Your Makefile file should have:
   (1) a new led_s.o production that builds led_s.o from led_s.s
   (2) a new blink_s.elf production builds a program name blind_s.elf
       that is linked with led_s.o rather than led_c.o. Note that the
       "main" method for both blink_c.elf and blink_s.elf is the same
       and defined within blink.c.
   (3) a new "install_s" production builds blink_s.elf (if necessary)
       and then installs it on a launchpad
   (4) the default (all) production compiles blink_s.elf and
       blink_c.elf
   >> After several attempts, I have tried to built the blink_s.elf
      by using the AS instead of CC as the configuration. Upon
      searching from Google, I found that I would have to (in the
      makefile) use a command something like:
      	 ${AS} ${CFLAGS} -o $@ -c $<
      which did not work either for building from the assembly code.
      However, testing with the current commands found in the current
      makefile I have uploaded to the SVN with this Readme, the test
      runs fine and as expected which keeps the alternating lights
      blinking as they should have been. I will visit a TA to see how
      to approach this issue and if I am doing it wrong.
      For this assignment, to utilize the pointers in the assebly
      code, I had assistance from Chelsey J. who took the class a
      year ago. She was the one who assisted me in using the .set
      function at the top of the s file for this assignment, as well
      as catching my syntax errors in the code.
