Complete the following exercise. We have deposited a program in your
"ch6" directory that builds and prints a linked list containing
name-and-age records it reads from a file. Memory for the linked list
is dynamically allocated using malloc() and freed using free(). Your
task is to modify this program so that the
	 - name-and-age records are stored in a binary search tree
	   sorted in lexographic order by name, and
	 - name-and-age records are printed in lexographic order by
	   an in-order tree traversal
Your program should store all tree nodes in dynamically allocated
memory and all dynamically allocated memory should be freed before
your program terminates.
