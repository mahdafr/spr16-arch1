Exercise 4-14: Define a macro swap(t,x,y) that interchanges two
arguments of type t. (Block structure will help.)
	  >> Taking the approach of utilizing sizeof to ensure their
length in bits will be equal, we can swap if this is true. So, my
define will check if they are the same size in bits (long=long,
int=int, etc.) and only then will I swap. My test cases include int
for all 3, long for all 3, and then t and x are int, and y is
short. This last case should not work. All tests work out fine (after
realizing some silly errors.)
