//submission requires illustrations of state machines implemented for
steps 2 and 3.

Part 1: Construct a Makefile that includes production to:
     - (toggle_c) compile led_press.c to a loadable elf file; this
       should be the default production
     - (clean) remove all files created from compilation
     - (load_c) load the elf file onto a launchpad board
       >> For this assignment, I am using my previous lab's Makefile
       	  (lab0-flash) as a guide for this lab's Makefile. 

Part 2: Implement toggle function
     - Define a simple i/o automata (IOA) that will toggle an LED
       each time the button is pressed.
     - Modify the led_press.c to implement this IOA.
The IOA should be implemented in a method update_state() that
     - reads input
     - computes one state change (if necessary)
     - updates output (if necessary)
     - update_state() should be in a file called transition_c.c that
       stores the currect state, updates the current state, and calls
       appropriate functions on a state transition.
update_state() should be called repeatedly by main() and neither loop
internally nor be recursive.
       >> 

Part 3: Debounce the switch
     - define a deterministic IOA that transitions only once every
       10ms which both debounces the button and implements the toggle
       function from Part 2.
     - implement a new program "debounce" that implements this IOA
       and modify the Makefile to compile (and load) both it and
       led_press
       >> 

Part 4: Convert your update_state method to assembly
     - create a new file called transition_s.s that contains the
       assembly version of your update_state function
     - transition_s.s should store the current state and call the
       *********
     - create a new make productions:
       	   = (toggle_s) compile transition_s.s to a loadable elf file
	   = (load_s) load the elf file onto a launchpad board
