Part 1: Modify sleep_600th.s to accurately delay 1/600th of a
second. Your lab submission should include a file name readme.txt that
clearly indicates how you
     (1) computed the changes to this file
     (2) tested that these changes function correctly
     >> If there are needed to have (1/600)*(10^6) / 3 cycles/s = 555
     	cycles delayed.

Part 2: Create a new assembly language source file name led_s.s that
implements a c-callable function led_control with the same semantics
as the version defined in led_c.c. Your Makefile file for should have:
   (1) a new led_s.o production that builds led_s.o from led_s.s
   (2) a new blink_s.elf production builds a program name blind_s.elf
       that is linked with led_s.o rather than led_c.o. Note that the
       "main" method for both blink_c.elf and blink_s.elf is the same
       and defined within blink.c.
   (3) a new "install_s" production builds blink_s.elf (if necessary)
       and then installs it on a launchpad
   (4) the default (all) production compiles blink_s.elf and
       blink_c.elf
